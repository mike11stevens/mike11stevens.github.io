I repeatedly find myself reminding… myself… that everyone has 24 hours in a day. Everyone. Every one. Please feel free to slap me if I say “I don’t have time”…because I DO. WE ALL DO.

What I don’t have is time to make things a priority that aren't. To do this thing called life right, I think we need to make sure our choices on how to spend time align with our priorities. By making an effort to strike “I don’t have time” from my speech, my hope is that the effort will help remind me to refocus on my priorities and bring them back to the forefront.

…and just in case you reject the “relative” confines of time in a 24 hour day:
